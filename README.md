House Price prediction and analysis

This data has been taken from kaggle competition- House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
I've trained a model based on the given data using Random Forest.
The R-squared score of model is 0.87 and MSE od 0.019.
The prediction work is done in the 'House-price-prediction.ipynb' file

Out of curiosity I've even done some analysis which may help in deciding what type of house should one buy.
The 'House-Price-Prediction.ipynb' file has the analysis.
I've used only the train data for the analysis.
